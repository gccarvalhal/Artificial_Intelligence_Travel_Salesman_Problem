# Artificial Intelligence: Travel Salesman Problem

**PROJECT DESCRIPTION:** Metaheuristics for Optimization/Decision Problems, the aim is to implement a system to solve an optimization problem, using different algorithms
or meta-heuristics such as: hill-climbing, simulated annealing, tabu search, and genetic algorithms (you may include other algorithms or variations of these). Multiple instances of the chosen problem must be solved, and the results obtained by each algorithm must be compared. Different parameterizations of the algorithms should be tested and compared, in terms of the average quality of the solution obtained and the average time spent to obtain the solutions. 


**CASE GOAL:** Find the local optimal solution for the problem of scheduling tasks with two diferrent strategies:
- **FLOW SHOP SEQUENCING** with 20 jobs and 5 machines 
- **JOB SHOP SCHEDULING** with 15 jobs and 15 machines 

Both strategies were implemented with CP model (or constrained programming) and MIP models (mixed integer linear programming). The goal is to analyse which of them found the best optimal local soluiton to the problem and verify the correctness and efficiency.
