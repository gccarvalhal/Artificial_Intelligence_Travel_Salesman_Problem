# Artificial Intelligence: Travel Salesman Problem

**PROJECT GOAL:** Explores the **TRAVEL SALESMAN PROBLEM (TSP)**.This problem (also called the travelling salesperson problem or TSP) asks the following question: "Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, what is the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city?".

**Hill-climbing**, **simulated annealing**, **tabu search** and **genetic** algorithms were used to analyze the best route for different sets of cities. 

**IMPLEMENTATION:** The idea of the TSP is to find a tour of a given number of cities/locations, visiting each of then exactly once and returning to the starting city/location where the length of this tour is minimized. In this work, hill-climbing, simulated annealing, tabu search and genetic algorithms has been used to analyze the best route and the time spent to process the solution for the following sets:

- **4 x 4 matrix (used for testing)**: travel between Porto, Braga, Aveiro and Viana do Castelo.

- **14 x 14 matrix:** travel between Lisboa, Porto, Braga, Setubal, Coimbra, Evora, Aveiro, Leiria, Faro, Viana do Castelo, Beja, Braganca, Castelo Branco and Guarda.

- **37 x 37 matrix:** travel between Amsterdam, Antwerp, Athens, Barcelona, Berlin, Bern, Brussels, Calais, Cologne, Copenhagen, Edinburgh, Frankfurt, Geneva, Genoa, Hamburg, Le Havre, Lisbon, London, Luxembourg, Lyon, Madrid, Marseille, Milan, Munich, Naples, Nice, Paris, Prague, Rome, Rotterdam, Strasbourg, Stuttgart, The Hague, Turin, Venice, Vienna and Zurich.

The aim is to present a comparative study among those algorithms for solving TSP.
